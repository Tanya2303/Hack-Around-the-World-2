# Travel your way

## 💡 Inspiration

Following the pandemic, there has been a significant increase in people's propensity for solo travel and the "workstation," and the number of lone travelers venturing out and seeing the world has increased as well. We looked at solo travelers' experiences and problems encountered by them, and we found two main issues: Obtaining cash and using an ATM for local money and language barriers that make it difficult to converse or place food orders.

## 💻 What it does

On Travel your way users can:

- Explore various places in VR and 3D.
- Write about your experience and share it with the world.
- Upload the image and convert it into translatable text.
- Learn about the places to travel by reading about them in blogs.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- Frontend: React JS
- Backend: Node JS
- Database: MongoDB
- NLP: Cohere

## 🗃️ Best Use of MongoDB Atlas

One of the reasons we were able to quickly build such a difficult technical project was that we significantly relied on MongoDB Atlas. We connected with our database, MongoDB, using the Mongo Atlas graphical user interface client. We used MongoDB as a second layer of caching. With this strategy, we use computation and storage more effectively to provide our software's users with a lightning-fast experience. In DB collections, we connected the login and usage history of our users. Because of MongoDB's relatively straightforward user interface, it was fun to use.

## 🤝 Most Creative Use of GitHub

I have used GitHub for the reasons listed below:

- CI/CD: We have used GitHub actions for CI/CD for the project.
- Setting up the project: Starting a project on GitHub couldn't be simpler.
- GitHub Project: To plan and monitor the development of our project utilizing GitHub projects.
- Utilizing PRs and Issues: In order to keep the project on track, we are creating numerous PRs and issues.

## 🤖 Best Use of NLP with Cohere

We are using Cohere NLP to summarize the blog written by travelers. Cohere helped a lot to complete the blog page. If you are in hurry and don't have enough time to read the complete blog you can just read the summary of the blog and learn from their experience.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Because we had to implement the project by a certain date, finishing the project was difficult.
- I had to learn how to use Cohere because I am a new user.
- Implementing the group page was a bit difficult.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- I was pleased that I was able to learn how to use Cohere.
- I was pleased that I was able to create a fully functional website that can help you while traveling.

## 📖 What we learned

- I learned how to use Cohere.
- I learned how to create a Full Stack web application.

## 🚀 What's next for Travel your way

- Implementing a filter to the blog page.
- Adding more places to explore the page.
- Adding more features for the Blogs page.
